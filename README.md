## Understanding Data Visualization

## Effective Data and Visualization

### [McCandless Method](https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/what-makes-a-good-data-visualization/) <a name="McMethod"></a>

  1. **Information:** the data you are working with
  2. **Story:** a clear and compelling narrative or concept
  3. **Goal:** a specific objective or function for the visual
  4. **Visual form:** an effective use of metaphor or visual expression 

### [Kaiser Fung’s Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup](https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/junk-charts-trifecta-checkup-the-definitive-guide.html) <a name="Kaiser"></a>

This approach has three checkup questions to help consumers of data visualization critique what they are consoming and to determine how effective it is.

  1. What is the practical question?
  2. What does the data say?
  3. What does the visual say?

### Avoiding misleading or deceptive charts

As a data analyst, the goal is to create visualization that is communicating the data used accurately and truthfully. In the chart below lies a summary of common errors to avoid that cause misleading information.

| What to avoid | Why |
|---|---|
| Cutting off the y-axis | Changing the scale on the y-axis can make the differences between different groups in your data seem more dramatic, even if the difference is actually quite small. |
| Misleading use of a dual y-axis | Using a dual y-axis without clearly labeling it in your data visualization can create extremely misleading charts. |
| Artificially limiting the scope of the data | If you only consider the part of the data that confirms your analysis, your visualizations will be misleading because they don’t take all of the data into account. |
Problematic choices in how data is binned or grouped | It is important to make sure that the way you are grouping data isn’t misleading or misrepresenting your data and disguising important trends and insights. |
| Using part-to-whole visuals when the totals do not sum up appropriately | If you are using a part-to-whole visual like a pie chart to explain your data, the individual parts should add up to equal 100%. If they don’t, your data visualization will be misleading. 
| Hiding trends in cumulative charts | Creating a cumulative chart can disguise more insightful trends by making the scale of the visualization too large to track any changes over time. |
| Artificially smoothing trends | Adding smooth trend lines between points in a scatter plot can make it easier to read that plot, but replacing the points with just the line can actually make it appear that the point is more connected over time than it actually was. |

## Decision Tree

How do you decide what is best for represetning your you?

The **decision tree** is a tool to aid in data-driven decision
